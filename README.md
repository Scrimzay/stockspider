this is basically a simple copy of anthonyggs'/anthdms' market monkey (similar names huh) but i stopped once i got a simple working gui/app working, he took it much further and i didnt plan on continuing with the project so it is what it is

you dont actually make any trades here or anything, its just a viewer for listed stock/crypto tickers

tutorial:

step 1. run the program or project

step 2. click any ticker you want

make sure to star the repo, follow my github and follow me on twitch and twitter(x)
